SWARM MODE THEORY
 
A cluster = A swarm
    a collection of docker engines joined into a cluster
    engines in a swarm run in swarm mode

A swarm consist 
    1+ manager nodes (3-5 recommended, only 1 is the leader)
        look after state of cluster dispatch tasks
    1+ worker nodes 
        accept and execute tasks
    Services
        declarative way of running and scaling tasks
        fe service and backend service
        let say we want 5 instances of the container running the fe

COMMANDS
Initialize swarm and a node as manager
    docker swarm init --advertise-addr 172.17.0.1:2377 --listen-addr 172.17.0.1:2377
Add a manager/worker
    docker swarm join-token manager - give us a command
        docker swarm join \
        --token SWMTKN-1-64k044f5a1hlcm8nm9nwj3pyj748fqxtdn0tftvj69z8gbkxge-3aql9a0bfuwl73rduxms33mrp 172.17.0.1:2377 \ 
        --advertise-addr 172.17.0.2:2377 \ 
        --listen-addr 172.17.0.2:2377

    docker swarm join-token worker - give us a command
