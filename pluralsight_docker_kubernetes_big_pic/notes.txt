----------------------------DOCKER-----------------------------------

a docker(container technology) works like a virtual mashine
    vm needs separate VM ect
    all docker images run on same server

docker image ls - lists all docker images
example - download image with app, fire it up as a new container, start it stop it 

CONTAINERS ARE LIKE FAST LIGHWEIGHT VIRTUAL MASHINES AND DOCKER NAKES RUNNING OUT APPS INSIDE CONTAINERS EASY

code > docker image > push to registry > start container from it

----------------------------KUBERNETES-----------------------------------
Docker provides mechanism of startin//stoping containers, but thats pretty low level
Kubernetes work on higher level - how many container to run in, which nodes to run them on, how to update them
