An app can have multiple containers for 
    front end
    database
    nodejs
    backend

How do you get you source code into a container
    put it in an image
    put it in container layer r/w - using volumes

Docker volumes
    dir in container = data volume

Creating data volume
    docker inspect mycontainer
    docker run -p 8080:3000 -v $(pwd):/var/www node

src_to_container--------------------------------
    create empty express project
    docker pull node
    docker run -p 8080:3000 -v /var/wwww node
        we should have volume under the cover
    docker inspect <id>
        we can check Mounts property
    docker rm -v 733b947a4776
        remove container and volume
    we should link the project folder into container
    docker run -p 8080:3000 -v $(pwd):/var/www -w "/var/www" node npm start
        let run on 8080 on the external with 3000 on the internal with set up volume
        that point to src in current directory and the volume thats inside in the container
        gonna point to the express site folder is var/www and use that volume as working directory 
        that way npm start is forward from var/www to src from express site

        open http://192.168.0.146:8080/ and the same site is live
